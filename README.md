üßæ Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/gaming-store.git
cd gaming-store

2. Set Up the Database

Create a MySQL database and a users table with the following structure:

sql

CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `names` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `admin` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

3. Configure the Database Connection

Update the connect.php file with your database credentials:

php

$host = "your-host";
$user = "your-username";
$pass = "your-password";
$dbname = "your-database";

$con = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass, $dbname);
if (!$con) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

4. Running the Application

    Place the project files in the root folder of your local server (e.g., XAMPP's htdocs folder).
    Start your local server (Apache and MySQL) using XAMPP.
    Open the application in your browser at http://localhost/gaming-store/login.php.

5. Logging In

    Use the following credentials to log in as an admin (make sure this data exists in your database):

bash

Email: admin@example.com
Password: your-password

üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

    Prepared Statements: SQL queries are prepared and executed securely to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    Password Hashing: Passwords are stored as hashes and verified using PHP's password_verify() function.
    Session Management: User sessions are securely managed, ensuring the safety of user data during their logged-in session.
